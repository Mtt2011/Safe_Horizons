                    As we mentioned in the natural disaster page tsunamis are huge wave that are at least 30 feets tall and they can be pretty dangerous so in this page we are gonna tell you how to survive a tsunami. First you will know the news so you need to run as much as you can and get to high places such as top of the buildings and we prefer you to not use cars to evacuate cause there is gonna be a lot of people on the way since the tsunami is coming and also you shouldn't use the elavator to get to hight places cuase the electricity may be cut of when you are in the elavator like in the movies so you better avoid it. And you better discuss with your family or relatives when you are gonna be gathering after the tsunami because there is a possibility that you will be seperated during the tsunami.

                        You will need some items or resources to survive so we chose some to help you survive the natural disaster.
                        First of all you will need a bagpack to carry things and a sleeping bag to sleep warmly.
                        You will also need some some matches to start a fire and a lighter in case the matches get wet and become unusable.
                        Next you will need some extra clothes to stay warm and to not catch a cold.
                        You will also need some canned food to eat because if you dont eat you will have no energy.
                        Nect you will need a bowl to cook in case you find something edible.
                        You will also need a knife to chop down vegetables and to fight hostile animals.
                        And lastly you will also need a rope to tie things if you need.
                        You can also take things if you need other than the ones we came up with.

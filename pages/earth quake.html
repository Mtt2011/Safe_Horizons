                    Earthquakes are dangerous because they can even make buildings collapse so we are going to tell you how to survive am earthquake first if you are in your house go under a table because some things can fall on you such as glasses and it can seriously injure you and if you dont have a table near you you should cover your head and neck with you hands to avoid getting head injuries. When the earthquake is over dont go into places with tall buildings cuz it can still fall so instead you should go to a field where there is no buildings.
